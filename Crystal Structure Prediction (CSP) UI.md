## Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) UI Development: A Detailed Guide for UI Developers

This document describes my approach toward developing the user interface (UI) for Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP). I will focus on UI development aspects, including data flow, visualization, user interaction, and integration with the backend API.

**Project Overview:**

My aim is to build a UI that visualizes the CSP process—predicting how molecules arrange in a solid (crystalline) state. The UI will have three main tabs, each representing a key step in the CSP workflow: conformer generation, crystal structure generation, and energy prediction.

**I. General UI Development Considerations:**

*   **User Experience (UX):** I will follow best practices for a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface. I will make sure that there is clear labeling, a logical layout, and easy navigation between tabs.
*   **Data Visualization:** This project heavily relies on effective data visualization. I will choose appropriate charting libraries and visualization techniques to represent molecular structures, crystal densities, and lattice energies.
*   **Responsiveness:** I will make the UI responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.
*   **Error Handling:** I will implement robust error handling to gracefully manage invalid inputs, API errors, and unexpected situations. I will display informative error messages to the user.
*   **Performance:** I will optimize the UI for performance, especially when handling large datasets of crystal structures. I will consider techniques like pagination or lazy loading if necessary.
*   **Code Maintainability:** I will write clean, well-documented, and modular code for future maintenance and enhancements.

**II. Tab-Specific UI Development Details:**

**A. Tab 1: 3D Conformer Generation**

*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  The user inputs a SMILES string (molecular representation).
    2.  I will send the SMILES string to the backend API.
    3.  The API will return XYZ or SDF files with the 3D coordinates of the generated conformers.
    4.  I will receive these files.
*   **UI Tasks:**
1.  **Input Field:** I will create a text input field for the SMILES string. I will optionally provide a file upload option for SMILES files.

2.  **Visualization Area:** I will implement a 3D molecular viewer using libraries like NGL view, 3Dmol.js, or similar. The viewer will allow users to:
        *   Rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D structures.
        *   Select and highlight individual conformers.
        *   Display conformer properties (if available from the backend).
3.  **Conformer Selection (Optional):** If the backend provides multiple conformers, I will consider a selection mechanism (e.g., a list or grid of thumbnails) to allow users to choose which conformers to use in subsequent steps.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   I will choose a suitable 3D molecular visualization library.
*   I will manage file-parsing logic for XYZ or SDF formats.
    *   I will handle smooth rendering of the potentially complex 3D structures.

**B. Tab 2: Crystal Structure Generation**

*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  I will obtain a list of selected conformers (from Tab 1) or accept direct input in case Tab 1 is bypassed.
    2.  Additional input parameters will be provided by the user: crystal generation method, space group, Z', number of crystals.
    3.  I will pass all input parameters to the backend API.
    4.  The API will generate the crystal structures and return the required data (e.g., crystal densities).
    5.  I will obtain the data related to crystal density.
*   **UI Tasks:**
    1.  **Input Fields:** I will make input fields for:
        *   Conformer selection—dropdown or file upload.
*   Crystal generation method (dropdown menu with "Polymorph" and future options).
        *   Space group (text input or dropdown).
        *   Z' (numeric input).
        *   Number of crystals to generate (numeric input).
    2.  **Data Processing:** I will process the received crystal density data to prepare it for plotting.
    3.  **Histogram Plot:** I will create a histogram to visualize the distribution of crystal densities using a suitable charting library (e.g., Chart.js, Plotly.js, D3.js). I will make sure to label the axes and include a clear title properly.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   I will handle the various input types such as file upload, dropdown, numeric inputs.
    *   I will select an appropriate charting library.
*   I will handle potentially large datasets of crystal densities efficiently.

**C. Tab 3: Energy Prediction and Analysis**

*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  I will retrieve the generated crystal structures (from Tab 2).
    2.  I will send the crystal structures to the energy prediction API.
    3.  The API will return the predicted lattice energies.
    4.  I will receive the lattice energies.
*   **UI Tasks:**
    1.  **Data Processing:** I will combine the crystal density data (from Tab 2) and the predicted lattice energies.
    2.  **Scatter Plot:** I will create a scatter plot with crystal density on the x-axis and lattice energy on the y-axis.
    3.  **Table Display:** I will create a table to display the most stable crystal structures (lowest lattice energies), including their names/filenames, rankings, and absolute lattice energy values.
4. **3D Crystal Structure Visualization:** I will show 3D visualizations of the chosen stable crystal structures, if possible, with structural overlaps.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   I will maintain data consistency between Tab 2 and Tab 3.
    *   I will provide data sorting and filtering for table display.
    *   I will do 3D visualization of crystal structures, potentially including unit cell representations and periodic boundary conditions.
    
**III. API Integration:**

*   **API Endpoints:** I will get the URLs and documentation of the backend APIs for each tab.
*   **Data Formats:** I will learn the data formats in use for API requests and responses (e.g., JSON, XML).
*   **Authentication (if required):** If authentication is needed to access the APIs, I will implement it.
*   **Error Handling:** I will also implement error handling to deal with API errors and display appropriate messages to the user.

**IV. Visualization Libraries and Tools:**

*   **3D Molecular Visualization:** NGL view, 3Dmol.js, Jmol.
*   **Charting Libraries:** Chart.js, Plotly.js, D3.js.
*   **General UI Frameworks:** React, Vue.js, Angular (I will choose based on project requirements and team expertise).

**V. Example UI Elements (Illustrative):**

*   **Tab 1:**
    *   Text input for SMILES string.
    *   3D viewer displaying rotating conformers.
    *   List of conformers with checkboxes for selection.
*   **Tab 2:**
    *   Dropdown for crystal generation method.
    *   Input fields for space group, Z', and number of crystals.
    *   Histogram of crystal densities.
*   **Tab 3:**
    *   Scatter plot of crystal density vs. lattice energy.
    *   Sortable table of stable crystal structures.
    *   3D viewers displaying overlapping crystal structures.

**VI. Development Workflow:**

1. API Familiarization: I will start with understanding the API endpoints, data formats, and authentication requirements.
2. UI Structure Design: I will plan the overall layout and navigation of the UI.
3. Tab-by-Tab Development: I will develop each tab incrementally, focusing on data flow, input/output, and visualization.
4. API Integration: I will integrate the UI with the backend APIs.
5. Testing and Refinement: I will thoroughly test the UI for functionality, usability, and performance.

The following is my plan as to how I will go about developing the CSP UI. I will maintain close communication with the backend developers and project stakeholders in ensuring seamless integration and a successful outcome.
